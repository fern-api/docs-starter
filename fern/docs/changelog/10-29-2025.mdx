## Enhancements

### Inventory tracking improvements
Added new `reserved` field to inventory responses, allowing better tracking of stock allocated to pending orders.

### Bulk operations
Introduced `/inventory/batch-update` endpoint for updating multiple plant inventory levels in a single request.

## Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue where low stock alerts weren't triggering when inventory reached exactly the reorder point
- Corrected timezone handling in inventory history timestamps
