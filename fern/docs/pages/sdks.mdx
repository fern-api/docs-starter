We provide official open-source client libraries for your favorite platforms. These clients make connecting to our API faster and help avoid errors.

We regularly update our SDKs using [Fern](https://buildwithfern.com/?utm_source=str-d/sdks) and adhere to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) (semver) principles, so we won't make breaking changes in minor or patch releases.
