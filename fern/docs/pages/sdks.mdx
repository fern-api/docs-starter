title: Petstore | SDKs
description: We offer client libraries/SDKs for your favorite languages, generated by Fern from your OpenAPI specification file. 
---

We provide official open-source SDKs (client libraries) for your favorite languages, such as Node.js and Python. These clients make connecting to our API faster and help avoid errors.

We regularly update our SDKs using [Fern](https://buildwithfern.com/?utm_source=docs-starter-openapi/sdks) and adhere to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) (semver) principles, so we won't make breaking changes in minor or patch releases.
