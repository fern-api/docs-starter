## Overview

The Plant Store API's plant management capabilities let you create, organize, and maintain your plant catalog with rich metadata and flexible categorization. Use it to create and update plant listings, organize by categories and tags, control availability status, and search and filter for customers and internal operations.

## Plant status values

Plants in your catalog have availability states that reflect inventory. Status should automatically sync with inventory levels to prevent overselling.

| Status | When to use |
|--------|-------------|
| `available` | In stock and ready to purchase |
| `pending` | Reserved for orders or incoming shipments |
| `sold` | No longer available for new orders |

<Warning>
Always update plant status when inventory changes. Stale status values lead to overselling and customer disappointment.
</Warning>

## Categorization strategies

Organize plants to help customers find what they need. Most successful plant stores use multiple categorization methods simultaneously.

| Strategy | Categories | Example use case |
|----------|-----------|------------------|
| **Care difficulty** | Easy, Moderate, Advanced | Help beginners find low-maintenance plants |
| **Environment** | Indoor, Outdoor, Tropical, Desert | Match plants to customer's space |
| **Size** | Small, Medium, Large | Filter by available space constraints |

Use categories for broad grouping (mutually exclusive choices like Indoor vs Outdoor), and tags for flexible overlapping labels like "pet-friendly", "air-purifying", or "low-light". This dual approach gives customers maximum flexibility when browsing.

<Tip>
Include scientific names alongside common names. Many experienced plant enthusiasts search by scientific names, and it helps differentiate between similar common names.
</Tip>

## Handling variants

Different pot sizes or colors of the same plant should be tracked separately for pricing and inventory purposes. Create separate plant records for each variant and link them using consistent tags or naming conventions. For example, "Snake Plant - 4 inch" and "Snake Plant - 6 inch" as distinct SKUs.

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| Separate products | Independent pricing and inventory | More records to manage |
| Single product with variants | Cleaner catalog | Complex inventory tracking |

<Note>
Most plant stores find separate products simpler to implement and more flexible for pricing adjustments.
