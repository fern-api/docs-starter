Fern provides two ways to edit your documentation: the command-line interface (CLI) for developers, and Fern Editor for team members who prefer a visual interface.

## Using the CLI

The Fern CLI lets you preview changes locally and publish updates from your terminal.

### Install the CLI

```bash
npm install -g fern-api
```

### Preview locally

Start a local development server with hot-reloading. Your docs automatically update as you edit Markdown and OpenAPI files:

```bash
fern docs dev
```

This serves your documentation at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Generate a preview link

Create a shareable preview URL for your team to review changes before publishing:

```bash
fern generate --docs --preview
```

Preview links are temporary and useful for getting feedback on changes before they go live.

### Publish to production

When you're ready for your docs to be publicly accessible:

```bash
fern generate --docs
```

This builds and publishes your documentation to the URL configured in `docs.yml`.

<Note>
For detailed CLI documentation, see the [Fern CLI reference](https://buildwithfern.com/learn/cli-api-reference/cli-reference/overview).

## Using Fern Editor

Fern Editor is a visual editor that lets anyone on your team update documentation without learning Markdown or Git. It's ideal for content writers, product managers, and other non-technical contributors.

### Key features

Fern Editor provides rich text editing similar to Notion or Google Docs, support for Fern components like Callouts and Cards, and a GitHub-backed workflow that creates pull requests for review.

### Get started

1. Log in to the [Fern Dashboard](https://dashboard.buildwithfern.com/)
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Open Fern Editor from the top navigation

Changes made in Fern Editor create pull requests automatically, maintaining your docs-as-code workflow with full Git history and review process.

<Note>
For more details on Fern Editor features and supported components, see the [Fern Editor documentation](https://buildwithfern.com/learn/docs/writing-content/fern-editor).
</Note>

## Writing content

Documentation pages are written in MDX, which combines Markdown with React components. Create `.mdx` files in the `docs/pages/` directory and reference them in your `docs.yml` navigation.

### Basic page structure

```markdown title="docs/pages/my-page.mdx"
---
title: Page title
subtitle: Optional subtitle
slug: my-page
---

Your content here. Use standard Markdown formatting like **bold**, *italic*, and `code`.

## Headings

Use headings to organize your content.
```

### Using components

Fern provides built-in components for common documentation patterns:

```jsx
<Note>
Highlight important information with callouts.
</Note>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="First card" href="/page-one">
    Card description
  </Card>
  <Card title="Second card" href="/page-two">
    Another description
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
```

<Note>
For a complete list of available components, see the [component documentation](https://buildwithfern.com/learn/docs/writing-content/components/overview).
</Note>

## Next steps

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Set up navigation"
    icon="duotone sitemap"
    href="/navigation"
  >
    Configure tabs, sections, and pages
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Customize your docs"
    icon="duotone palette"
    href="/customization"
  >
    Brand your documentation
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
