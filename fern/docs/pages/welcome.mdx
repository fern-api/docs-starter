title: Welcome to the Fern docs starter
subtitle: A template for building beautiful API documentation with Fern
slug: welcome
---

This repository is a starter template for building documentation with [Fern](https://buildwithfern.com). It includes a sample Plant Store API to demonstrate how Fern generates interactive API reference documentation from an OpenAPI specification.

Use this template to get started quickly, then replace the sample content with your own API and documentation.

## What's included

This starter template contains everything you need to publish documentation:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `docs.yml` | Configures navigation, theme, and hosting |
| `fern.config.json` | Sets your organization name and CLI version |
| `openapi.yaml` | Sample Plant Store API specification |
| `docs/pages/` | Markdown content for your documentation |
| `docs/assets/` | Logos, favicon, and other assets |
