## Getting started

To get started, customize the links, content, and theme to match your brand! 

## SDKs

In addition to documentation, Fern can generate SDKs (client libraries) in popular programming languages. That way, you can offer users an experience such as:

<CodeBlocks>
  <CodeBlock title="Node">
  ```bash
  npm install your-organization
  # or
  yarn add your-organization
  ```
  </CodeBlock>
  <CodeBlock title="Python">
  ```bash
  pip install your-organization
  ```
  </CodeBlock>
  <CodeBlock title="Go">
  ```bash
  go get -u github.com/your-organization/go
  ```
  </CodeBlock>
  <CodeBlock title="Java">
  ```bash
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.your-organization</groupId>
    <artifactId>your-organization</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.0</version>
  </dependency>
  # or
  implementation("com.your-organization.java:sdk:2.0.0")
  ```
  </CodeBlock>
  <CodeBlock title="Ruby">
  ```bash
  gem install your-organization
  ```
  </CodeBlock>
  <CodeBlock title="C#">
  ```bash
  nuget install your-organization.net
  ```
  </CodeBlock>
</CodeBlocks>
