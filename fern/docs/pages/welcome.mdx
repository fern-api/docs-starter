Welcome to the Pet Store API docs! This site demonstrates how to use Fern to generate API documentation from an OpenAPI specification file. You can [use this site template](https://github.com/fern-api/docs-starter-openapi) as a starting point for your own API documentation. 

## Getting Started

Here you'll find information about managing your pets, customers, and orders for your pet shop.
