## Getting started

To get started, customize the links, content, and theme to match your brand! 

## SDKs

In addition to documentation, Fern can generate SDKs (client libraries) in popular programming languages. That way, you can offer users an experience such as:

<CodeBlocks>
  <CodeBlock title="TypeScript">
  ```bash
  npm install your-organization
  ```
  </CodeBlock>
  <CodeBlock title="Python">
  ```bash
  pip install your-organization
  ```
  </CodeBlock>
  <CodeBlock title="Go">
  ```bash
  go get -u github.com/your-organization
  ```
  </CodeBlock>
  <CodeBlock title="Java">
  ```bash
  go get -u github.com/your-organization
  ```
  </CodeBlock>
  <CodeBlock title="Java">
  ```bash
  <dependency>
  <groupId>com.workos</groupId>
  <artifactId>workos</artifactId>
  <version>{version}</version>
  </dependency>
  ```
  </CodeBlock>
</CodeBlocks>
