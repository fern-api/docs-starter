Light is essential for photosynthesis and healthy plant growth. Understanding your home's light conditions and matching them to the right plants is key to success.

## Light levels explained

### Full sun (direct light)
- **6+ hours** of direct sunlight per day
- Usually south-facing windows
- Hot, bright spots
- Best for: Succulents, cacti, herbs, vegetables, flowering plants

### Bright indirect light
- **4-6 hours** of bright but filtered light
- Near east or west-facing windows
- Light is bright but not hitting plants directly
- Best for: Most tropical plants, ferns, many houseplants

### Medium light (partial shade)
- **2-4 hours** of indirect light
- Several feet from a bright window
- North-facing windows
- Best for: Pothos, philodendrons, snake plants

### Low light (shade)
- **Less than 2 hours** of indirect light
- Corners of rooms, hallways
- Far from windows
- Best for: Snake plants, ZZ plants, cast iron plants

## How to assess your light

### The shadow test
Hold your hand 12 inches above where you want to place your plant:
- **Sharp, defined shadow**: Bright/direct light
- **Soft, fuzzy shadow**: Medium light
- **Barely visible shadow**: Low light

### Watch the sun
Observe your space throughout the day:
- **Morning sun** (east): Gentle, great for most plants
- **Afternoon sun** (west): Intense, can be too hot
- **All-day sun** (south): Brightest, best for sun-lovers
- **No direct sun** (north): Lowest light

## Signs of light problems

### Too much light
- Bleached or faded leaves
- Brown, crispy patches (sunburn)
- Leaves turning yellow
- Wilting despite adequate water
- Soil drying very quickly

### Too little light
- Leggy, stretched growth
- Leaning toward light source
- Small, pale new leaves
- Slow or no growth
- Lower leaves dropping
- Variegated plants losing patterns

## Solutions for light issues

### Increasing light
- Move closer to windows
- Use mirrors to reflect light
- Clean windows and leaves (dust blocks light)
- Paint walls white or light colors
- **Use grow lights** for low-light spaces

### Reducing light
- Move away from windows
- Use sheer curtains to filter light
- Place plants behind taller plants
- Relocate to north-facing windows

## Grow lights

When natural light isn't enough, supplement with artificial lighting:

### Types of grow lights
- **LED**: Energy-efficient, cool, full spectrum
- **Fluorescent**: Good for seedlings and herbs
- **Full spectrum bulbs**: Mimic natural sunlight

### Grow light tips
- Place 6-12 inches above plants
- Run for 12-16 hours per day
- Use timers for consistency
- Adjust height as plants grow

## Seasonal changes

### Summer
- Longer days mean more light
- Watch for sun damage as sun angle changes
- May need to move plants away from windows

### Winter
- Shorter days mean less light
- Consider moving plants closer to windows
- Supplement with grow lights if needed
- Rotate plants more frequently

## Pro tips

- **Rotate plants weekly** for even growth on all sides
- **Acclimate gradually** when moving to brighter spots
- **Clean leaves monthly** to maximize light absorption
- **South-facing windows** get the most light in Northern Hemisphere
- **Observe your plants** - they'll tell you what they need
- **Use the right window** - not all windows are equal
