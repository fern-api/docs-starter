Healthy plants start with healthy soil. Understanding soil composition and proper fertilization will help your plants thrive.

## Soil basics

### What makes good soil?

Good potting soil should:
- **Drain well** - excess water flows through
- **Retain moisture** - holds some water for roots
- **Be airy** - allows oxygen to roots
- **Provide nutrients** - contains organic matter

### Soil components

#### Potting mix
- Pre-mixed blend for containers
- Usually contains peat moss, perlite, vermiculite
- Sterile and pest-free
- Best for most houseplants

#### Garden soil
- Too heavy for containers
- Compacts and doesn't drain well
- Use only for outdoor beds

#### Amendments
- **Perlite**: White volcanic rock, improves drainage
- **Vermiculite**: Retains moisture
- **Coco coir**: Sustainable peat alternative
- **Bark/Orchid mix**: For orchids and epiphytes

## Soil for different plants

### Cacti & succulents
- Fast-draining mix
- Add extra perlite or sand
- 1 part potting soil + 1 part perlite

### Tropical plants
- Moisture-retaining but well-draining
- Standard potting mix works well
- Can add peat moss for moisture

### Orchids
- Special orchid bark mix
- Large chunks for air circulation
- Never use regular potting soil

### African violets
- Light, airy mix
- Special African violet soil available
- Good drainage is essential

## When to repot

Signs it's time for fresh soil:
- Roots growing out of drainage holes
- Water sits on surface instead of absorbing
- Plant drying out very quickly
- Soil is compacted or breaking down
- Been 2+ years since last repotting

## Fertilizer fundamentals

### NPK ratios

The three numbers on fertilizer (e.g., 10-10-10):
- **N (Nitrogen)**: Leaf and stem growth
- **P (Phosphorus)**: Root and flower development
- **K (Potassium)**: Overall plant health

### Types of fertilizer

#### Liquid fertilizer
- Fast-acting
- Applied with watering
- Most common for houseplants
- Dilute to half strength

#### Slow-release pellets
- Lasts 2-6 months
- Releases gradually
- Easy to use
- Good for outdoor plants

#### Organic options
- Compost
- Worm castings
- Fish emulsion
- Seaweed extract

## Fertilizing schedule

### Growing season (spring & summer)
- Feed every 2-4 weeks
- Plants are actively growing
- Follow package instructions
- Use half-strength for houseplants

### Dormant season (fall & winter)
- Reduce or stop fertilizing
- Feed every 6-8 weeks if at all
- Plants aren't growing much
- Lower light = less food needed

## Fertilizer by plant type

### Heavy feeders
Vegetables, flowering plants, fast growers
- Feed every 2 weeks in growing season

### Moderate feeders
Most houseplants, herbs
- Feed every 3-4 weeks in growing season

### Light feeders
Succulents, cacti, slow growers
- Feed every 6-8 weeks or less

## Signs of fertilizer problems

### Over-fertilizing
- White crust on soil surface
- Brown leaf tips and edges
- Wilting despite adequate water
- Stunted growth
- Salt buildup

**Solution**: Flush soil with water, reduce feeding frequency

### Under-fertilizing
- Pale or yellow leaves
- Slow growth
- Small leaves
- Poor flowering
- Weak stems

**Solution**: Start regular feeding schedule

## Pro tips

- **Less is more** - it's easier to add than remove fertilizer
- **Water first** - never fertilize dry soil (can burn roots)
- **Dilute liquid fertilizer** to half the recommended strength
- **Flush soil periodically** - water thoroughly to remove salt buildup
- **Use balanced fertilizer** (equal NPK) for general use
- **Read labels carefully** - follow instructions for each plant type
- **Organic is gentle** - harder to over-fertilize with organic options
- **Stop feeding before repotting** - new soil has nutrients
