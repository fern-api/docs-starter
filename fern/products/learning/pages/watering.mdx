Watering is one of the most important aspects of plant care, yet it's also one of the most common areas where mistakes happen. Overwatering is the #1 cause of plant problems!

## General watering guidelines

### Check before you water
Always check soil moisture before watering. Stick your finger about 2 inches into the soil:
- **Dry**: Time to water
- **Slightly moist**: Wait a day or two
- **Wet**: Don't water yet

### How much to water
When you do water, water thoroughly:
- Water until you see it drain from the bottom of the pot
- This ensures the entire root system gets moisture
- Empty the drainage tray after 15-30 minutes

### Water quality
- Use room temperature water when possible
- Let tap water sit overnight to allow chlorine to evaporate
- Filtered or distilled water is ideal for sensitive plants
- Rainwater is excellent if you can collect it

## Watering by plant type

### Succulents & cacti
- Water deeply but infrequently
- Allow soil to dry completely between waterings
- Reduce watering in winter months
- Typically every 2-3 weeks

### Tropical plants
- Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged
- Never let soil dry out completely
- Mist leaves for extra humidity
- Typically every 5-7 days

### Ferns
- Keep soil evenly moist at all times
- Never let soil dry out
- High humidity lovers
- Typically every 3-5 days

### Herbs & vegetables
- Water when top inch of soil is dry
- Consistent moisture for best growth
- Morning watering is ideal
- Typically every 2-3 days

## Signs of watering problems

### Overwatering
- Yellow leaves
- Mushy stems or base
- Moldy soil surface
- Root rot (dark, mushy roots)
- Fungus gnats

### Underwatering
- Drooping or wilting leaves
- Brown, crispy leaf edges
- Slow growth
- Leaves falling off
- Dry, pulling away from pot sides

## Seasonal adjustments

### Spring & summer (growing season)
- Water more frequently
- Plants are actively growing
- Higher temperatures increase water needs

### Fall & winter (dormant season)
- Reduce watering frequency
- Plants grow slower or go dormant
- Cooler temperatures mean slower evaporation

## Pro tips

- **Morning watering** is best - gives plants all day to absorb moisture
- **Ensure drainage holes** - standing water leads to root rot
- **Use mulch** on top of soil to retain moisture
- **Group thirsty plants** together for easier care
- **Set reminders** until you learn each plant's schedule
- **Adjust for pot size** - smaller pots dry out faster
