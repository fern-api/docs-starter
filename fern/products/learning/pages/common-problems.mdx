Even with the best care, plants can encounter problems. Here's how to identify and treat the most common issues.

## Common pests

### Fungus gnats
**What they look like**: Tiny black flies around soil

**Causes**:
- Overwatering
- Moist soil surface

**Solutions**:
- Let soil dry between waterings
- Yellow sticky traps
- Add sand or perlite to soil surface
- Hydrogen peroxide soil drench (1 part H2O2 : 4 parts water)

### Spider mites
**What they look like**: Tiny dots, fine webbing on leaves

**Signs**:
- Stippled, yellowing leaves
- Fine webbing between leaves
- Leaves dropping

**Solutions**:
- Spray with water to knock off
- Neem oil or insecticidal soap
- Increase humidity
- Isolate infected plants

### Aphids
**What they look like**: Small green, black, or white soft-bodied insects

**Signs**:
- Clusters on new growth
- Sticky honeydew on leaves
- Distorted new leaves

**Solutions**:
- Spray off with water
- Insecticidal soap
- Neem oil
- Introduce beneficial insects (ladybugs)

### Mealybugs
**What they look like**: White cottony masses on leaves and stems

**Signs**:
- White fuzzy spots
- Sticky residue
- Stunted growth

**Solutions**:
- Dab with rubbing alcohol on cotton swab
- Insecticidal soap
- Neem oil spray
- Quarantine infected plants

### Scale insects
**What they look like**: Brown or white bumps on stems and leaves

**Signs**:
- Hard or soft bumps
- Sticky leaves
- Yellow spots

**Solutions**:
- Scrape off with fingernail or soft brush
- Rubbing alcohol application
- Neem oil or horticultural oil
- Persistent treatment needed

## Common diseases

### Root rot
**Causes**: Overwatering, poor drainage

**Signs**:
- Mushy, black roots
- Yellow leaves
- Wilting despite wet soil
- Foul smell from soil

**Solutions**:
- Remove from pot, trim dead roots
- Repot in fresh, well-draining soil
- Reduce watering frequency
- Ensure drainage holes exist

### Powdery mildew
**What it looks like**: White powdery coating on leaves

**Causes**:
- High humidity + poor air circulation
- Overcrowding

**Solutions**:
- Improve air circulation
- Remove affected leaves
- Neem oil spray
- Baking soda solution (1 tbsp per gallon water)

### Leaf spot
**What it looks like**: Brown or black spots on leaves

**Causes**:
- Fungal or bacterial infection
- Water on leaves
- Poor air circulation

**Solutions**:
- Remove affected leaves
- Avoid getting leaves wet
- Improve air circulation
- Fungicide if severe

## Nutrient deficiencies

### Nitrogen deficiency
- Pale yellow leaves, especially older ones
- Stunted growth
- **Fix**: Apply balanced fertilizer

### Iron deficiency
- Yellow leaves with green veins
- Affects new growth first
- **Fix**: Use fertilizer with chelated iron

### Magnesium deficiency
- Yellow edges on older leaves, green veins
- **Fix**: Epsom salt solution (1 tsp per gallon)

## Environmental problems

### Sunburn
**Signs**: Brown, crispy patches on leaves

**Solutions**:
- Move away from direct sun
- Use sheer curtains
- Gradually acclimate plants to brighter light

### Cold damage
**Signs**: Black or brown soggy spots, wilting

**Solutions**:
- Keep away from drafts and AC vents
- Maintain temperature above 50°F for most plants
- Move away from cold windows in winter

### Low humidity
**Signs**: Brown crispy leaf tips and edges

**Solutions**:
- Mist plants regularly
- Use pebble trays with water
- Group plants together
- Use a humidifier

## General troubleshooting

### Yellow leaves
**Possible causes**:
- Overwatering (most common)
- Underwatering
- Nutrient deficiency
- Natural aging (lower leaves)

### Brown leaf tips
**Possible causes**:
- Low humidity
- Underwatering
- Fertilizer burn
- Fluoride in tap water (use filtered)

### Drooping/wilting
**Possible causes**:
- Underwatering (soil dry)
- Overwatering (soil soggy)
- Root rot
- Transplant shock

### Leggy growth
**Possible causes**:
- Insufficient light
- Too much fertilizer
- Natural growth pattern

## Prevention tips

- **Quarantine new plants** for 2-3 weeks
- **Inspect regularly** - catch problems early
- **Clean leaves monthly** - removes dust and pests
- **Provide good air circulation** - prevents fungal issues
- **Don't overcrowd** - allows for inspection and airflow
- **Use sterile tools** when pruning or propagating
- **Water properly** - most problems stem from watering issues
- **Match plant to environment** - right plant, right place

## When to give up

Sometimes it's better to compost a severely infested or diseased plant:
- Pest infestation that won't resolve
- Severe root rot with no healthy roots
- Protecting other plants from spread
- Plant is more stressed than thriving

Remember: It's okay to start over!
